# Simple Voice-Enabled Calculator

## Description
This is a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction). It also provides voice feedback using the `pyttsx3` text-to-speech library.

## Features
- Supports four basic mathematical operations: 
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
- Takes user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
- Provides voice feedback for the calculated result.
- Displays the result in the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyttsx3` library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd calculator-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose an operation (`mult`, `div`, `add`, `sub`).
4. Listen to the voice response and view the result in the console.

## Error Handling
- If an invalid operation is entered, the program provides an error message both in text and voice.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional operations (square root, exponentiation, etc.).
- GUI-based interface for better user interaction.
- Voice command input instead of text input.
